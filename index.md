## About 
I am an <ins>AI Engineer</ins> and <ins>EMT</ins> with a deep commitment to:

* technology
* healthcare
* social justice 

My journey has been shaped by a lifelong dedication to building solutions that create real-world impact, whether through emergency medical response, machine learning, or structural innovation.

> My path wasn’t conventional. I was originally drawn to advocacy and
> humanitarian efforts, inspired in 2017 by the resilience of frontline 
> responders in Syria during the civil war. That same sense of duty led me 
> to become an EMT, where I gained hands-on experience in emergency care 
> and saw firsthand how inefficient healthcare systems can be. Over time, I 
> realized that real, lasting impact doesn’t come from just working within 
> the system—it comes from innovating to change it.

Today, I work at the intersection of AI, engineering, and public benefit to create solutions that improve healthcare access, strengthen infrastructure, and rebuild communities. Here’s what I’m currently focused on:

- [x] Building AI-driven solutions in healthcare and engineering
- [ ] Developing a Structural Damage Assessment AI to estimate rebuilding costs and optimize infrastructure restoration
- [x] Leveraging ML for large-scale, ethical, and impactful innovations
- [x] Leading advocacy efforts for justice, equity, and sustainable change

I believe technology should empower people, not replace them. Whether through:

1. AI-driven healthcare solutions
2. rebuilding critical infrastructure
3. driving ethical progress in engineering
   
I aim to create systems that uplift communities and support the underserved.

I am always open to collaborations, research opportunities, and conversations on how we can use AI for social good, healthcare, and humanitarian impact. Let’s connect.
